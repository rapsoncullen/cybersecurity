- POP or Post Office Protocol and IMAP or Internet Message Access Protocol are both email protocols who are responsible for the transfer of email between a client and a mail server. 
## POP
- POP works by downloading the inbox to the client from the mail server
## IMAP
- IMAP works by synchronizing the current inbox with new mail on the server, downloading anything new. This means if a message is gone from the server but is still on the client it will be kept. (Useful)
